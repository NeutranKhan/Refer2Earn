Build a web application called "Refer2Earn Liberia" using Django with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Let the AI decide any additional tech stacks or libraries as needed.

Core Concept:
This is a referral-based earning platform. Users pay 1,500 Liberian Dollars per month via Mobile Money. They can earn credits and payouts by referring friends.

Features:
1. User Authentication:
   - Sign up, login, logout.
   - Each user gets a unique referral code.

2. Subscription Payment:
   - Integrate with Liberian Mobile Money providers (Lonestar Cell MTN Mobile Money, Orange Money Liberia).
   - Users pay 1,500 LRD/month subscription via Mobile Money.
   - Payment confirmation stored in database.

3. Referral Program Logic:
   - Each user has a referral code.
   - When a new user signs up and pays subscription with a referral code:
     - Referrer earns 500 LRD/month credit for as long as the referral stays subscribed.
   - If a user has 3 active paying referrals:
     - Their subscription is auto-covered (3 × 500 LRD = 1,500 LRD).
   - If a user has more than 3 referrals:
     - They start earning cash payouts of 500 LRD per extra referral each month.
   - Example: 4 referrals = free subscription + 500 LRD payout; 5 referrals = free subscription + 1,000 LRD payout.

4. Referral Dashboard:
   - Show number of referrals, current credits, payout balance.
   - Progress bar: “Invite 3 friends → free forever. Invite more → start earning.”

5. Admin Panel:
   - Manage users, referrals, and payouts.
   - View subscription stats and revenue.
   - Approve or trigger Mobile Money payouts.

6. Fraud Prevention:
   - Referral rewards only activate after referred user completes at least 1 billing cycle.
   - Prevent duplicate accounts with same phone number.

Business Logic:
- At each billing cycle, check referral counts for each user.
- Apply credits or payouts automatically.
- Payouts sent via Mobile Money transfer to user’s registered phone number.

Deliverables:
- Django project with modular apps: accounts, referrals, subscriptions, payouts.
- Referral dashboard page.
- Admin dashboard for payouts and fraud monitoring.
- Production-ready code with comments explaining key logic.
